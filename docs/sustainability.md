# Sustainability

**Supporting DazzleML development and maintenance**

---

## Why Support DazzleML?

DazzleML is part of the [DazzleProj](https://github.com/DazzleProj) ecosystem - open-source AI development tools that save time and solve real problems.

**Current sponsorship: $0/month | Goal: $1,000/month**

---

## The Real Cost of AI Tools

AI tools require significant ongoing effort:

### Development Challenges
- **Testing across hardware**: NVIDIA, AMD, different GPUs
- **Rapid ecosystem changes**: ComfyUI updates monthly
- **Platform support**: Windows, Linux, macOS quirks
- **Performance optimization**: Every GPU generation different
- **Integration complexity**: MCP, TodoAI, other systems

### Ongoing Maintenance
- ComfyUI compatibility updates
- New CUDA toolkit versions
- Python ecosystem changes
- Security patches
- Bug fixes and support

**Without funding**: Development happens in spare time, updates slow down, features delayed.

**With funding**: Dedicated time for development, faster updates, new features.

---

## Value Proposition

### Example: ComfyUI Triton Installer

**Time saved vs manual setup**:
- Manual installation: 4-6 hours first time
- Ongoing maintenance: 2 hours/month for updates
- Troubleshooting: 1-3 hours when issues arise

**Your hourly rate**: $75-150 for professional work

**One-time value**: $300-900
**Monthly value**: $150-300

**Our ask**: $25-50/month to ensure continued development

**ROI**: Your time savings pay for sponsorship in first month.

---

### Example: find-best-images

**Manual curation time**:
- 1,000 images × 3 seconds each = 50 minutes
- Repeated weekly: ~40 hours/year
- At $100/hour = $4,000/year in time

**Tool cost**: Free + open source
**Suggested sponsorship**: $25/month = $300/year

**Savings**: $3,700/year
